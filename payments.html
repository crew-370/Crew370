    <h2 class="head2">Venmo</h2>
    <p class="info">You can make camping and high adventure payments using Venmo. Troop 370 prefers Venmo because merchant fees are waived for payments that don't use a credit card. You must make payments via the Venmo app. When paying, you must include SCOUT NAME and EVENT NAME with your payment in the 'What's it for?' section.</p>
    <p class="info">To pay, download the app and add Troop-ThreeSeventy as a Venmo friend. Alternatively, you can click the button below to go to the Troop 370 Venmo page.</p>
    <p class="info">Credit card payments will incur merchant fees.</p>
    <h3 class="button">Pay Using Venmo</h3>

    <h2 class="head2">PayPal</h2>
    <p class="info">Use the 'Friends & Family' transfer option to make payments without merchant fees. This option is available only if your Paypal and bank account are connected. Credit card payments will incur merchant fees.</p>
    <p class="info">Send money via Paypal to troop370treasurer@gmail.com and include SCOUT NAME and EVENT NAME with your payment.</p>
    <p class="info">If you are paying for multiple campers or events, please pay for them in separate Paypal transactions, NOT in a single payment. Otherwise, you risk not getting credited for some campers.</p>
    <h3 class="button">Pay Using PayPal</h3>

    <h2 class="head2">Cash or Check</h2>
    <p class="info">Hand-deliver these payment types to the Trip Captain or the Scoutmaster, preferably at the weekly Wednesday meetings. The current Trip Captain is listed on the sign-up form for the monthly campout.</p>
